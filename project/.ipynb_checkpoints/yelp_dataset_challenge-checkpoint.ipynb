    "## Introduction\n",
    "Yelp academic data set provides wealth of information about businesses in 5 cities. This data set will be used to build a prdictive model to see how well a restaurent success is based on location. The dataset consist of five differenct types of data about a restaurent.\n",
    "1. About the restaurent such as name, precise location, address, overall rating,and catagory.\n",
    "2. The reviews of each restaurents provided by customers.\n",
    "3. some information about the custormer, such as how many reviews, average starts given, friends network in yelp\n",
    "4. check ins by customers\n",
    "5. tips given by customers\n",
    "***provide more information about dataset ***\n",

    "How well a surronding commercial value of a location of a restaurent can predict the restaurent success.\n",
    "1. How do we define a restaurent is successfull ?\n",
    "Location:\n",
    "The choice of location is expected to have significant impact on the success or failure of a restaurant. Success of a location depends not only on its physical site, but also its surrounding demographics. In other words, location is a complex construct that encompasses geographic, as\n",
    "well as demographic and psychographic variables. Any changes in geographic or demographic/psychographic variables of a specific location could have significant impact on the attractiveness of a location. For example, Kahiki Restaurant located in Columbus, Ohio was ranked as one of the Top 100 restaurants in the US. It was visited by several Hollywood and national celebrities as a destination restaurant. Over next three decades, this particular location continued to become less attractive as the affluent of the neighborhood moved, leaving empty spaces, vacant houses, and ‘brown fields’. Eventually Kahiki was closed for good as the location became impossible to operate profitably. In this case, the geographic factors of the location did not change much, but the demographics changed; resulting restaurant failure.\n",
    "In another situation, a restaurant in Ohio was forced to close its operations after operating nearly 20 years in the same location. In this case, the demographics actually improved over the 20 years making the location very attractive. However, as this small town grew, the city government decided to build embankments on both sides of the road to improve public safety. These embankments totally obscured the restaurant from customers’ view. As a result, customers were forced to go to the next traffic light and take a turn to visit this restaurant; compromising the convenience factor which is so important for the industry. This restaurant was closed eventually due to reduced patronage as a result of the lack of visibil"

So from the review we should be able to pickup some information about locations to look for a parking spots for a business in a busy streets. The algorithm should use  reviews, tips, and location of the business to try to find a parking spot. Natural Language processing techniques should be used to find information from reviews. Location mining can be used to find busy streets. And the parking spot should be less than 1/4 of a mile.The average person's stride length is approximately 2.5 feet long. That means it takes just over 2,000 steps to walk one mile. So a person has to walk about 500 steps from parking to business."

I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them.

The entire range appears to be turf, which may or many not help your game, but it looks really nice.  The tee boxes look state of the art and the club house looks like something you'll see on a newer course.  Can't wait to experience it!\n",

When i went in i was having problems with my Blacberry and had to switch to the Iphone last week. Rob from the Pennsylvania store who i was connected today was able to look at my bill and all the notes and correct the problem immediately. Great Customer Service!

      "This place was DELICIOUS!!  My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak's \"25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh\" and he's usually pretty accurate.  His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!  Oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take CASH ONLY.  So come prepared, but I'm pretty sure I saw an ATM there as well.  And I do believe they are closed on Sundays & Mondays.\n",

MANY, MANY years later, I stopped in there with some fond memories, and once again felt welcomed and valued as a customer, even though they didn't know who I was.  THE SANDWICHES are done Pittsburgh-style, sort of like Primanti's, and they are as perfect today as they were back in ancient times when I first started visiting the place.  Alexion's is a clean and peaceful little place in the Rook Station part of Green Tree, the oldest part of the town.

Coming from Texas, it was nice to see a course located amongst the hilly and woody Pennsylvanian terrain. It can be frustrating that it is literally impossible to make a hole-in-one on most every hole and that the course also makes it extremely difficult to predict the direction on how the ball will follow through and bounce.  The cartoon-like outrageousness of the course proved to give laughs and a fun attempt to play.  Improvements were being made and I will look forward to returning on my next visit to the Pittsburgh area.  I enjoy traveling and visiting new courses and the only reason why I didn't give this location 5 stars is because it was impossible to intuitively shoot the ball for a best effort to beat par.\n",

Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me.

I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant.

My fiance had what they called a 'mixed grill.\"  It consisted of eggs, peppers, onions and home made sausage.  Not something you would eat everyday, but he loved it!   They also had great coffee.  They actually ground up the beans in front of us.  Now that's fresh.\n",

      "On our current road trip of baseball, brews, hockey and diners, we decided to try Gab & Eat based on yelpers rating putting it #1 for breakfast in Pittsburgh area. We have to agree with most other reviewers that this is a place to eat.\n",
      "We arrived around noon on Saturday and were happy there were a couple open tables. The place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it. There is plenty of parking.\n",
      "Inside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time. Country style decorations and signs are mixed with nostalgia signs & posters. Most interesting are all the signatures and comments written on the wall by past customers. We regretted not having a marker to add ours. The other highlight was three large white boards with trivia questions - fun way to spend time waiting for food.\n",
      "The waitstaff there is...uh, experienced. They are attentive, pleasant and efficient.\n",
      "After reading reviews I had to try the Mixed Grill. But S went with pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were outstanding...maybe the best either of us has eaten. They were thick but with light texture and rich flavor. \n",
      "His bacon was cooked just as requested - as crisp as possible - and very flavorful.\n",
      "The Mixed Grill is a mixed together concoction of eggs, potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese, and spicy Italian sausage grilled together. I'm glad I heeded those who stressed going with the half size order. It filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order. I couldn't finish it all and that's rare. How do they serve the whole potion -- in a trough?\n",
      "Everything was cooked well. The sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes. You can build your own mix but the basic was a good mix.\n",
      "My only complaint was the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain. I like home fries with lots of seasoning that have aged on the grill. These potatoes were pretty uniform chunks with little seasoning. Personal preference.\n",
      "It usually comes with Italian toast but they were out so I went with raisin. It was delicious soft inch thick slices.\n",
      "Coffee was excellent and the cup stayed full. The total was less than $15. Fabulous value for the quality and portions.\n",
      "While I can't say it's the best breakfast in Pittsburgh (only here 3 days), its the best so far and one of the best we've had.\n",

      "Met my nephew for lunch in Carnegie and he suggested Gab & Eat.   Way to go Justin!  The restaurant is in a strip mall across from the Dairy Queen.  The grill is right up front so you can see them cooking.   They have counter space for eating and tables/booths for 4.   Don't expect to sit at one table if you have more than 4. They have a great looking breakfast menu.   We all got burgers of varying kinds!  They were tasty!   The buns were buttered, toasted and soft.  Yum!   the amount of butter didnt bother me  but it did my whiny mother. Who whined even though there is a no whining sign as you walk in the door.   We ordered fresh cut fries as onion rings.  Both of which were great.  The half order was plenty and a nice option to a full order.   The restaurant was full of local men at lunch which is usually a good sign.  I give it a 4 star only because of the waitress who kind of threw straws, silverware and napkins at us as she walked behind the counter.  At least she didn't throw the food when it came!   She also served the fries and Onion rings way before our burgers came out which was kind of weird.   They were nice and hot but would have been cold had we waited for the burgers.   It didn't factor into my four star rating but I deduct a star from nephew because he invited us out to lunch then allowed me pay!   Just kidding Justin!   Love ya!\n",

      "I have been coming to Gab n Eat for almost 20 years and They have never let me down. I get a typical breakfast if eggs, ham, toast, and home fries. Delicious as usual. The ambience however is usually lacking. The walls are dark, with writing and signatures of semi famous people all over the place. Pictures of local people hang on the walls(i secretly want mine up there) along with posters galore. While its fun to look at the first 10 times, it gets a little boring after awhile. So today when I arrived I expected the same old experience. Wow was I wrong! As soon as I looked at the door I knew something was different. The place seemed lighter and brighter. To my pleasant surprise, they painted and got new counter tops!! They're not quite done yet but the place has a new Happy vibe to it. The awesome breakfast, the new decor and the 5 guys sitting at the counter making me laugh are why I will be back( maybe for lunch).\n",
